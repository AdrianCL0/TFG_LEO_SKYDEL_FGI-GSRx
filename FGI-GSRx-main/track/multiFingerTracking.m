%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Correlator finger generation for multi finger tracking
%
% Inputs:
%   tR              - Results from signal tracking for one signals
%   ch              - Channel index
%   fingers         - Generated codes for fingers 
%
% Outputs:
%   tR              - Results from signal tracking for one signals
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Set local variables
trackChannelData = tR.channel(ch);
iBasebandSignal = trackChannelData.iBasebandSignal;
qBasebandSignal = trackChannelData.qBasebandSignal;

% Let's generate all fingers
for i=1:nrOfFingers
    corr_out_all(:,i) =  sqrt((sum(fingers.Code(i,:)  .* iBasebandSignal))^2 + (sum(fingers.Code(i,:)  .* qBasebandSignal))^2);

% Copy to structure
trackChannelData.corrFingersOut = trackChannelData.corrFingersOut + corr_out_all;

% Copy updated local variables
